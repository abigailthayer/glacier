Glacier code for original assignment - glacier_final2.m is the final code for week 1.

Glacier code revisited (for assignment to spend a second week on a project of choice) - glacier6.m is the final code for week 2. This code requires the txt file for d18O, and generates glacier_evolution2.mov

(disregard glacier_final.m and glacier_evolution.mov - old versions of projects and output)
